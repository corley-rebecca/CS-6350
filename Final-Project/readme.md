For grading purposes, please refer to train.py and eval_performance_ratio.ipynb. In train.py I implement the random forest algorithm and the Jupyter Notebook was used for producing figures used in analyses.

Upon Dr. Zhe's approval, I did not publish data as it is against collaboration policy. Please reach out if you have any questions or concerns about data.
